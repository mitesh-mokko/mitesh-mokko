### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mitesh Shah and I love to build stuff. I am a startup CTO, full stack software engineer, game maker and music composer. I also dabble - in coffee, wine, writing, food plating + photography and legos. Currently looking for my next gig. Got ideas? Let's talk!

### Tech Stack

These are some of my favorite technologies / libraries to build with. I consider iteration time to be an extremely important metric - especially in the context of startups where moving fast and changing directions quickly are a definitive business advantage.

- ReactJS
- React Native
- Expo
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Unity3D
